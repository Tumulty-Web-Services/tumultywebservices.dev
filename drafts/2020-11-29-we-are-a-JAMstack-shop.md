## The developers at Tumulty Web Services love to use the JAMstack, mainly because we like to bring diversity together.

### What is the JAMstack?

You're starting a business and need a website or you're a manager at 500+ and you need a custom tool to make your team work better. The first thing you look for is a web developer. You soon realize its not that simple. There are variety of different types of developers and even more programming languages. But, you don't care about programming languages or the difference between a backend developer a frontend developer. You need someone who can get the job done. 

If I may give you insight on the the type of developer you should be looking for if you want "someone who can get the job done." You should look for a JAMstack developer. Why? Because they were will focus entirely on getting your product made, and use the latest services and tools at their exposal to get the job done. 

What JAMstack developers do is build apps on top of other services that are secure and designed to execute a single purpose. For example, if you need an app that has private pages and also take in payments. A normal developer will build an app with custom authentication and payment processing services. What a JAMstack developer will do is build an app using Auth0.com and the Stripe API. JAMstack developers understand they aren't going build an Authentication service as Auth0.com, so they will take advantage of the services provided by Auth0.com to give you a secure website.
