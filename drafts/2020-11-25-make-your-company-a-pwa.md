### What is a PWA?

Before we jump into how making your customers happy. We need to get the horse, before the carriage. What is a PWA? PWA stands for progressive web application and it is a website that uses bleeding-edge web technologies to provide users an ehanced web experience. 

A non-pwa, aka a normal website is can look pretty, load at blazing fast speeds, and handle some complex user interaction. But, what a non-pwa website can't do is act like a mobile app or a desktop application.

**A PWA can act like both a mobile and desktop application**

According to the [google documentation](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/)

"Progressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed so they are capable, reliable, and installable."

The *keyword here* is **INSTALLABLE.** 

This is cool because your users can download your website like they would download a mobile app or desktop app. They are free from having to use a browser to access the site.

A good example of a website that are downloadable PWAs are [weather.com](https://weather.com) and [smashingmagazine.com](https://smashingmagazine.com). If you go to either one of these websites take a look at the small icon on the right side of the browser bar.

If you click that the site will download onto your desktop. 

**Non-PWA sites don't have this feature.**

Its this basic feature that gives your website the capability to act like either a mobile and desktop application.

I'll mention this because its super important, because of this "installable" feature you can make your website available from the Google Play Store or iTunes App Store and have it downloadable like a native mobile application.
