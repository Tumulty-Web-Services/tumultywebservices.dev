## When people think of UX they think of content strategy and design. But what is equally as important is how fast your website loads. Let's talk about speed

### What do we mean by speed?
To a regular user, measuring how fast a website load is a time from request to where the page is rendered. However,  a page loading isn't a single moment in time but a full experience, and this experience can't be measured by a single metric. A page can load quickly in all but one metric, and it'll be that one metric that determines its overall speed. 

The way we should think about speed is similar to [Cliff from Cheer's Buffalo theory](http://mjboesen.incolor.com/Literature/Buffalo_Theory.HTML). A website only moves as fast as its slowest metric.

Rather than measuring load with just one Google Network Metric, you should time each moment during the experience that affects the user's perception of load speed. When a user navigates to a web page, they're typically looking for certain types of feedback:

It's more important to know how the user experiences a web page request to understand these metrics.

* Did my request for the page go through?
* Has enough content loaded to inform the user their request is being fulfilled
* Can the user start interacting with the content?
* Is the user interaction pleasant, or is it slow or janky?

Here are the Google Network Metrics associated with each one of these questions

* (Did my request for the page go through?) First Paint, First Contentful Paint
* (Has enough content loaded to inform the user their request is being fulfilled) First Meaningful Paint
* (Can the user start interacting with the content?) Time to Interactive
* (Is the user interaction pleasant, or is it slow or janky?) Cumulative Layout Shift

### Why is speed important?

Speed is one of the foundations of an exceptional user-experience; here are a handful of reasons why this is.

#### User retention

There is a stat floating around the web that states, "If your page takes longer than 3 seconds to load. You just lost a user."

Whether that is entirely true or not, there is some significant evidence supporting optimizing your site for speed can positively impact user retention. [Here's another statistic](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7)

"Pinterest reduced perceived wait times by 40% and this increased search engine traffic and sign-ups by 15%."
