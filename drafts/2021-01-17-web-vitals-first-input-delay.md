## As a developer, you want to be confident that your webpage will make a good first impression on a user. 

If you want to make a good impression on first-time users make sure that the web page sloads fast -- like super fast. The Google Vital Core metrics, First Contentful Paint (FCP), measures how quickly content reaches the browsers upon request.

However, what's more important are the following fators:

1. How fast your browser can paint the first pixel of your webpage
2. How resposive the web page is when the user begins to interact with it

These factors are measured by another Google Vital Core metric, First Input Delay. 

### Breaking down First Input Delay metric

First Input Delay measures the time the relationship between user interaction and the browsers ability to fullfil that interaction. An example, is when a user clicks on a button and how long it takes the browser and JavaScript logic to execute the button's function.

#### High scoring First Input delay

The goal for any web developer is to get their pages to have a First Input Delay less than 100 milliseconds.

As developers who write code that responds to events, we often assume our code is going to be run immediately—as soon as the event happens.
