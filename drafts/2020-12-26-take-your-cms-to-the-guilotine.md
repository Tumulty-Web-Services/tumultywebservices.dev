## I'm not saying take your CMS to the guillotines, I'm saying make your CMS accessible for all-sorts of software

### What kind of CMS do I have now?

Wordpress powers 38% of the internet, and is 63% of all CMS' are Wordpress. If you are using Wordpress then you are using a traditional CMS. The same can be said if you are using Drupal or Joomla. If you aren't using one of these CMS' please drop the name of the CMS you are using in the comment section I'd love to know more about it.  

** Okay, I'm using a traditional CMS good. I don't know what that is...**

A traditional CMS (content management system), is a tool used to store content like web pages, blog posts, images, videos etc. in a database and make them easily accessible. Content Management Systems make web page building easy for people who don't know how to code. That's cool though the web is for everyone, not just the developers. The reason why a CMS like WordPress is so widely popular is they make websites easy to publish and develop for everyone. I actually started my career soley developing WordPress, and I am still a huge fan of it after 10+ years in the web development business.

*Discuss how they work why this bad... & link to previous article*

I know there is drama between the founder of Matt Mullenberg and the JAMstack architecture. If I could ever meet Matt my advice would be "WordPress is an awesome CMS, why not double down on what it's good at?"
