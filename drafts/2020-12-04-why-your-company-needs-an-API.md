## Create a unique experience for your customers with a company API.

<sub>**Quick Read:** APIs connect seperate services together, they make products easier to use, your data can be transformed into an API, your company API can make for unique customer experiences.</sub>

API is an acronym for [(Application Programming Interface)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24407/application-programming-interface-api), and if this is the first time you're hearing this term, it's nothing but gibberish. So, this blog post intends to give you a birds-eye view of what it is and how it can provide value to your customers. Before we jump into the meat of this not-so-technically in depth article. You probably use APIs every day and not even know it.

### Common APIâ€™s used by businesses

Have you ever paid for something on an e-commerce site using PayPal? Have you ever [logged into a website by using your Gmail account?](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/about-auth) Then guess what you've used an API before. They are what make the web easy to use, and they are what brings completely separate websites together.

Did you ever notice how easy it was to pay for that thing on that e-commerce site? Or how easy it was to gain access to that private account using your Gmail account?

Yeah, well, now you can see how, just maybe, APIs can make your company services more comfortable to use. Here are only a few of my favorite APIs that businesses all over the world use.

1. **Stripe API** Stripe is a software-as-a-service that [securely processes credit card information](https://stripe.com/). I've used them for multiple apps, and I simply love this company. The main reason for the love is their easy to use API. I can have secure payment processing in various projects thanks to their open and easy to use API.

2. **Google Maps API** No matter the age, once you get a certain level of comfort with the web, sooner or later, you stumble upon [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps). You start by putting in your home address, and at least sixty minutes later, you find yourself scoping out rare parts of Antarctica. Besides being a fun time-suck, Google Maps can be a very useful tool. For example, I have a client that needed a service that gave customers driving directions from their location to their office.

    *How did I provide them with that service?*

    **Google Maps API!**
    
  I took the data Google provided via their API plus a location finder tool and mapped it to my client's address. And just like that product made clients and customers happy!

3. **GIPHY API** It's hard for me to see how this API is beneficial to businesses. To me, this API is just plain fun! With the Giphy API, you can get a list of fun gif pictures based on user-generated data or random. I've had a lot of experience teaching at coding boot camps, and one of their class projects is to build an app around this [image data API](https://developers.giphy.com/).

    *Here's an example of some data provided by giphy*

4. **Yelp API** No business exists without a customer, and the kingdom where all the customers live is [Yelp](https://yelp.com). If you are waking up from your long slumber under a rock, Yelp.com is where customers go to review their experiences using your company's services. It started way back when as a website to review only restaurants, but they've exploded since them. If you're rubbing the sleep out of your eyes and somehow you're still in business. It's incredibly important to get yourself on Yelp.

If you're someone who wants to get involved with a conversation with those customers who leave you a review. You should encourage your customers to talk about your business, and you should get involved in their discussions. I like the Yelp API because you can bring all those conversations in-house and make it a part of your product with the Yelp API.

The Yelp API is designed to integrate with your app no matter the environment. And I can bet, next time you snoop on your competitor's products, you'll find that their yelp reviews will show up somewhere in their app. And, I can further bet that they are using the Yelp API to make that happen. I think that if your a business and aren't interfacing with customer reviews somehow, call Tumulty Web Services (908-331-1057) now and get a quote. Don't worry, it won't be expensive. It's easy for developers to use. It won't cost a fortune to get the API integrated with your product.

### How APIs Provide Value To Your Customers?

Now that you have a basic define of an API and have some examples of their power. It's time to think about your customers. Like how API opens up connections between services, we can start talking about open up connections between your products and your customers via an API.
