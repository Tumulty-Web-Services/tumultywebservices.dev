## Wordpress is the king of the web for a reason. It's an amazing content management system. But, I'd never use it for building web pages.

### Why Wordpress is a great CMS

I've worked with marketing teams who swear by Wordpress. They swear by Wordpress, because when they are handed down some new content from the higher-ups, and with ease they publish a stylish, seo-friendly blog post. 

And, when they need to publish custom posts with a unique set a data, thanks to [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), Wordpress is easily extenable. 

Yeah, WordPress is the swiss army knife of the internet.

### Why you shouldn't build your website using it

Speed & Security (use contents of the glldd.com)

### What you should be building your site with

A static site generator 11ty or with more complex user-interfaces next.js 

### How it all works

Going back to the best parts of Wordpress. It has a very robust API ecosystem and is slowly building out a customizable GraphQl. So you can interface with modern front-end site builders 

Best of both worlds
