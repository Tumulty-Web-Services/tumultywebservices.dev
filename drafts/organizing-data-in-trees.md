## A tree is a a common data structure that actually resembles a tree, but inverted. The root is at the botom and the branches grown downard.

Each one of these downward growing branch is made up of nodes, and these nodes are linked in a specific order.

### Terminology

Nodes: are numerical points that contain some form of data
Edges: are the lines that stress the direction of where the tree is growing

Together, the nodes and their attached edges create a tree.

### The technical

<!-- left off transcription here  pg.32-->
More formally, a tree can be defined as either the empty tree, or a node with a list of successor trees. Nodes are usually, though not always, labelled with a data item (such as a number or search key). We will refer to the label of a node as its value. In our examples, we will generally use nodes labelled by integers, but one could just as easily choose something else, e.g. strings of characters.
