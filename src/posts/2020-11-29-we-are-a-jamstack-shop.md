## The developers at Tumulty Web Services love to use the JAMstack. Mainly,because we like to bring diversity together.

### What is the JAMstack?

You're starting a business and need a website, or you're a manager at 500+ company, and you need a custom software app to make your team work better. The first thing you do is look for a web developer. You soon realize it's not that simple. There are a variety of different types of developers and even more programming languages. The search can become overwhelming and frustrating because finding the right developer can be just as difficult as learning to write code yourself. You don't have time to understand the complexities of navigating the web development world. You need someone quick, affordable, and who can get the job done.

If I may give you insight into the type of developer you should be looking for if you want "someone who can get the job done." You should look for a [JAMstack developer](https://jamstack.wtf/).

**Why?**

Because they will focus entirely on getting your product made and use the latest services and tools at their disposal to get the job done. 

JAMstack developers build apps on top of other secure and well-designed services to execute a single purpose. For example, if you need an app that has private pages and also take in payments. An average developer will build an app with custom authentication and payment processing services. What a JAMstack developer will do is create an app using [Auth0.com](https://auth0.com/) and the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/). JAMstack developers understand they aren't going to build an Authentication service as good as Auth0.com, so they will take advantage of the services provided by Auth0.com to give you a secure website.

### Why Jamstack?

When hiring a developer, here are a few reasons why you should look for someone who understands JAMstack architecture.

#### Cost-effective

Since an application built using JAMstack architecture pulls in services and other APIs, getting it built is quicker. The developer doesn't have to worry about making extra features like authentication or [photo loading](http://cloudinary.com/), making the cost much lower than something that will take longer to complete. Also, since developers pull in services and tools to help develop the app, often, these services have a free tier that costs nothing to integrate. Only when you require more services because hopefully, your application has more users that these services start charging.

#### Scalable

If you are starting small but expect growth, then having your app built using the JAMstack architecture is your best bet. Here's a quote straight from [JAMstack.com](https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/).

"Popular architectures deal with heavy traffic loads by adding logic to cache popular views and resources. The Jamstack provides this by default. When sites can be served entirely from a CDN there is no complex logic or workflow to determine what assets can be cached and when."

With Jamstack sites everything can be cached in a content delivery network. With simpler deployments, built-in redundancy and incredible load capacity."

**Wait...**

How am I supposed to understand any of that? Ultimately, what applications designed using the JAMstack architecture are served to the user via a [CDN (Content Delivery Network)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/). So pictures, videos, images, text dynamic, and functionality (like shopping carts) are shipped using a network of hosting servers closer to your users. So your site is loaded much faster, improving the overall experience.

#### Secure

Traditionally, when a user comes to your website, they put in the URL in their browser, and then the magic of the Internet grabs all the contents and puts it together, displaying the webpage. 

This old way of doing things leaves a lot of [opportunity for hackers to infultrate](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) (if they can analyze how the requests move over the network base on the page's contents). However, by default, applications built using the JAMstack architecture, and its contents being sent over a CDN pre-generate all the page's assets. Meaning, when the user goes to your website, all the assets(again, images, videos, text) are organized beforehand. So when it's requested by the user, there isn't server logic organizing things. 

#### Performance

If you haven't put it together, this CDN thing improves many aspects of a website, and a JAMstack takes full advantage of its power. I think the performance of an application comes from the points of the previous two sections. A CDN is a network of hosting servers where your site lives, making the request much closer to the user. The fact that all the pages are prebuilt makes it safer, but the files are much smaller. And, asking for a small file that lives down the block is much easier to get than a bigger file that is much further away. 

<sup>**Quick take-a-away:** JAMstack sites are better performant than, say, a WordPress site because the site's pages live a multiple server network, and each page is pre-built rather than at the time it is requested.</sup>

### So what's so diverse about it?

Now that I sang the JAMstack's praises, let me share what I really like about the JAMstack. From my experience, the web is a vast, diverse place with a lot of different tools and services. I am a creative type who likes to explore them all. With the JAMstack, I don't feel so pigeon-holed into being one type of software developer. With the JAMstackI can build an application that uses cutting edge server-side render technology using Next.js with a WordPress backend that integrates with custom micro-services built using Go and MongoDB.

I don't expect you to know what any of that means, but what it should demonstrate is that I am pulling a lot of different technologies together. I like doing that mainly because it keeps my skills as a developer sharp. I am under the belief, a belief developed through experience, that many technologies can do a lot of things, but some do some things better than others. So, when I build a product for a customer, I want to give them the best of the best. With the diversity philosophy behind the JAMstack, I can provide the customer with the best possible product because I can pull in tools and services that are top of the line into that product.
