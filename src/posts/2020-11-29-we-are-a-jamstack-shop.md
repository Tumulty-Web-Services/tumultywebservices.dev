### What is the JAMstack?

You're starting a business and need a website or you're a manager at 500+ and you need a custom tool to make your team work better. The first thing you look for is a web developer. You soon realize its not that simple. There are variety of different types of developers and even more programming languages. But, you don't care about programming languages or the difference between a backend developer a frontend developer. You need someone who can get the job done. 

If I may give you insight on the the type of developer you should be looking for if you want "someone who can get the job done." You should look for a JAMstack developer. Why? Because they were will focus entirely on getting your product made, and use the latest services and tools at their exposal to get the job done. 

What JAMstack developers do is build apps on top of other services that are secure and designed to execute a single purpose. For example, if you need an app that has private pages and also take in payments. A normal developer will build an app with custom authentication and payment processing services. What a JAMstack developer will do is build an app using [Auth0.com](https://auth0.com/) and the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/). JAMstack developers understand they aren't going build an Authentication service as Auth0.com, so they will take advantage of the services provided by Auth0.com to give you a secure website. 

### Why Jamstack?

When hiring a developer, here are a few reasons why should you look for someone who understands JAMstack architecture.

#### Cost-effective

Since an application built using JAMstack architecture pulls in services other APIs time to production is much quicker (developers don't have to worry about making extra features like authentication or [photo loading](http://cloudinary.com/)), making the cost much lower than something that will take longer to make. Also, since developers pull in services and tools to help develop the app, often times, these services have a free tier that costs nothing to integrate. Only when you require more services, because hopefully you application has more users that these services start charging.

#### Scalable

If you are starting small, but expect growth then having your app built using the JAMstack architecture is your best bet. Here's a quote straight from [JAMstack.com](https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/).

"Popular architectures deal with heavy traffic loads by adding logic to cache popular views and resources. The Jamstack provides this by default. When sites can be served entirely from a CDN there is no complex logic or workflow to determine what assets can be cached and when."

With Jamstack sites everything can be cached in a content delivery network. With simpler deployments, built-in redundancy and incredible load capacity."

Wait...

How am I supposed to understand any of that. Ultimately, what applications designed using the JAMstack architecture are served to the user via a [CDN (Content Delivery Network)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/).

#### Secure

#### Performance

#### Maintainability

### What so diverse about it?

Now that we've established how building your app using the JAMstack architecture is your best bet. Let's elaborate on why "the developers at Tumulty Web Services love to use the JAMstack. Mainly,because we like to bring diversity together."
