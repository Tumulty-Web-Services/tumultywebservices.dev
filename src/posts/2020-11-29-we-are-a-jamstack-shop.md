## The developers at Tumulty Web Services love to use the JAMstack. Mainly,because we like to bring diversity together.

### What is the JAMstack?

You're starting a business and need a website or you're a manager at 500+ and you need a custom tool to make your team work better. The first thing you look for is a web developer. You soon realize its not that simple. There are variety of different types of developers and even more programming languages. But, you don't care about programming languages or the difference between a backend developer a frontend developer. You need someone who can get the job done. 

If I may give you insight on the the type of developer you should be looking for if you want "someone who can get the job done." You should look for a JAMstack developer. Why? Because they were will focus entirely on getting your product made, and use the latest services and tools at their exposal to get the job done. 

What JAMstack developers do is build apps on top of other services that are secure and designed to execute a single purpose. For example, if you need an app that has private pages and also take in payments. A normal developer will build an app with custom authentication and payment processing services. What a JAMstack developer will do is build an app using [Auth0.com](https://auth0.com/) and the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/). JAMstack developers understand they aren't going build an Authentication service as Auth0.com, so they will take advantage of the services provided by Auth0.com to give you a secure website. 

### Why Jamstack?

When hiring a developer, here are a few reasons why should you look for someone who understands JAMstack architecture.

#### Cost-effective

Since an application built using JAMstack architecture pulls in services other APIs time to production is much quicker (developers don't have to worry about making extra features like authentication or [photo loading](http://cloudinary.com/)), making the cost much lower than something that will take longer to make. Also, since developers pull in services and tools to help develop the app, often times, these services have a free tier that costs nothing to integrate. Only when you require more services, because hopefully you application has more users that these services start charging.

#### Scalable

If you are starting small, but expect growth then having your app built using the JAMstack architecture is your best bet. Here's a quote straight from [JAMstack.com](https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/).

"Popular architectures deal with heavy traffic loads by adding logic to cache popular views and resources. The Jamstack provides this by default. When sites can be served entirely from a CDN there is no complex logic or workflow to determine what assets can be cached and when."

With Jamstack sites everything can be cached in a content delivery network. With simpler deployments, built-in redundancy and incredible load capacity."

Wait...

How am I supposed to understand any of that. Ultimately, what applications designed using the JAMstack architecture are served to the user via a [CDN (Content Delivery Network)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/). So everything pictures, videos, images, text dynamic functionality (like shopping carts), are shipped using a network a hosting servers that are closer to your users. So your site is loaded much faster improving the overall experience.

#### Secure

Tradtionally, when a user comes to your website the put in the URL in their browser and then the magic of the Intrnet grabs all the contents puts it together and displays the webpage. Sadly, this old way of doing things leaves a lot of [opportunity for hackers to infultrate](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) (if they can analyze how the requests move over the network base on the pages contents). However, by default applications built using the JAMstack architecture, and its contents being sent over a CDN pre-generate all the page's assets. Meaning, that when the user goes to your website all the assets(again, images, videos text) are all organized and put together before hand. So when its requested by the user there isn't server logic organizing things. 

#### Performance

If you haven't put it together this CDN thing improves a lot of aspects of a website, and an JAMstack takes full advantage of the power of a CDN. I think the perfomance an application comes from the points of the previous two sections. A CDN is a network of hosting servers where your sites lives making the request much closer to the user. And, the fact that all the pages are prebuilt making the not only safer, but the files are much smaller. And, asking for a small file that lives down the block is much easier to get than a bigger file that is much further away. 

<sup>**Quick take-a-away:** JAMstack sites are better performant than say a Wordpress site, because the pages of the site live an multiple server network and each page is pre-built rather than at the time it is requested. </sup>

### So what's so diverse about it?

Now that I sang the JAMstack's praises, let me share with you what I really like about the JAMstack. From experience, the web is a vast diverse place with alot of different tools and services. I am a creative type, who likes to explore them all. With the JAMstack, I don't feel so pigeon-holed into being one type of software developer. With the JAMstack and I can build an application that uses cutting edge server side render technology using Next.js with a Wordpress backend, that integrates with custom micro-services built using Go and MongoDB.

I don't expect you to know what any of that means, but what it should demonstrate is that I am pulling alot of different technoliges together. I like doing that mainly because it keeps my skills as a developer sharp, but also I am under the belief, a belief developed through experience, that many technologies can do a lot of things, but some do things better than others. So, when I build a product for a customer I want to give them the best of the best. With the diversity philosophy behind the JAMstack I can give the customer the best possible product.
