So, this blog post intends to give you a birds-eye view of what it is and how it can provide value to your customers. Before we jump into the meat of this not-so-technically in depth article. You probably use APIs every day and not even know it.</p><h3>Common API’s used by businesses</h3><p>Have you ever paid for something on an e-commerce site using PayPal? Have you ever <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/about-auth">logged into a website by using your Gmail account?</a> Then guess what you've used an API before. They are what make the web easy to use, and they are what brings completely separate websites together.</p><p>Did you ever notice how easy it was to pay for that thing on that e-commerce site? Or how easy it was to gain access to that private account using your Gmail account?</p><p>Yeah, well, now you can see how, just maybe, APIs can make your company services more comfortable to use. Here are only a few of my favorite APIs that businesses all over the world use.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Stripe API</strong> Stripe is a software-as-a-service that <a href="https://stripe.com/">securely processes credit card information</a>. I've used them for multiple apps, and I simply love this company. The main reason for the love is their easy to use API. I can have secure payment processing in various projects thanks to their open and easy to use API.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google Maps API</strong> No matter the age, once you get a certain level of comfort with the web, sooner or later, you stumble upon <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>. You start by putting in your home address, and at least sixty minutes later, you find yourself scoping out rare parts of Antarctica. Besides being a fun time-suck, Google Maps can be a very useful tool. For example, I have a client that needed a service that gave customers driving directions from their location to their office.</p><p><em>How did I provide them with that service?</em></p><p><strong>Google Maps API!</strong></p></li></ol><p>I took the data Google provided via their API plus a location finder tool and mapped it to my client's address. And just like that product made clients and customers happy!</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>GIPHY API</strong> It's hard for me to see how this API is beneficial to businesses. To me, this API is just plain fun! With the Giphy API, you can get a list of fun gif pictures based on user-generated data or random. I've had a lot of experience teaching at coding boot camps, and one of their class projects is to build an app around this <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">image data API</a>.</p><p><em>Here's an example of some data provided by giphy</em></p><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/nGMnDqebzDcfm/giphy.gif" alt="coding cowboy"></p></li><li><p><strong>Yelp API</strong> No business exists without a customer, and the kingdom where all the customers live is <a href="https://yelp.com">Yelp</a>. If you are waking up from your long slumber under a rock, Yelp.com is where customers go to review their experiences using your company's services. It started way back when as a website to review only restaurants, but they've exploded since them. If you're rubbing the sleep out of your eyes and somehow you're still in business. It's incredibly important to get yourself on Yelp.</p></li></ol><p>If you're someone who wants to get involved with a conversation with those customers who leave you a review. You should encourage your customers to talk about your business, and you should get involved in their discussions. I like the Yelp API because you can bring all those conversations in-house and make it a part of your product with the Yelp API.</p><p>The Yelp API is designed to integrate with your app no matter the environment. And I can bet, next time you snoop on your competitor's products, you'll find that their yelp reviews will show up somewhere in their app. And, I can further bet that they are using the Yelp API to make that happen. I think that if your a business and aren't interfacing with customer reviews somehow, call Tumulty Web Services (908-331-1057) now and get a quote. Don't worry, it won't be expensive. It's easy for developers to use. It won't cost a fortune to get the API integrated with your product.</p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Email Validator API</strong> If your marketing team does any e-mail marketing they've undoubtedly delt with spam. A custom in-house program built using the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/pozzad/api/email-validator-1">Email Validtor API</a> can prune and clean your email lists. Ensuring that your content is hitting the most optimal customers. You may also be thinking that a custom in-house app? We can't afford that, well you should look into hiring a JAMstack developer. A <a href="/we-are-a-jamstack-shop/">JAMstack developer can build a cost-effective software solution</a> for your team using the Email Validator API.</li></ol><h3>How APIs Provide Value To Your Customers?</h3><p>Now that you have a basic definition of an API and have some examples of their power. It's time to think about your customers. Like how API opens up connections between services, we can start talking about open up connections between your products and your customers via an API.</p><p>I think it's important to start asking yourself, is my company doing enough to improve the customer experience? If so, great, but there are always ways to improve.</p><p>The second thing to start thinking about is a set of general data that might be of value to your customers? If there is, and you don't mind exposing that data to the customer. Then you have grounds to start developing a company API that can provide value to your customers.</p><p>The main take away is that if your customers spend any time online and interact with your product. You can extend that product's value with data served up via API.</p><h3>How can we build an API for your company?</h3><p>The team at Tumulty's web services can help you develop your API ideas if you thoroughly know the concept. All you need to bring to the table is an open mind. Be open to the idea of making your product customizable based on the personality of your customer, and be open to shifting your perspective on the use of your data. Together, we can enhance your product and brings its value to new and uncharted places.</p><a href="/" class="my-4 text-1xl font-black text-green-800 flex md:justify-end underline">Back to home page</a></section></article></div><div class="max-w-screen-lg xl:max-w-screen-xl mx-auto"><section id="form" class="mt-10 max-w-screen-lg xl:max-w-screen-2xl mx-auto"><h3 class="text-left font-bold text-3xl text-gray-800 ml-6">Get in touch</h3><form class="flex flex-col w-100 md:w-3/5 my-8 mx-8 md:mx-auto pb-14" netlify><label class="sr-only" for="name">Name</label> <input id="name" type="text" name="name" placeholder="Full name" class="mt-4 p-2 border-2 border-green-700 focus:border-green-500 block w-100 text-base rounded-md"> <label class="sr-only" for="email">Email</label> <input id="email" type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" class="mt-4 p-2 border-2 border-green-700 focus:border-green-500 block w-100 text-base rounded-md"> <label class="sr-only" for="phone">Phone</label> <input id="phone" type="phone" name="phone" placeholder="Phone" class="mt-4 p-2 border-2 border-green-700 focus:border-green-500 block w-100 text-base rounded-md"> <label class="sr-only" for="message">Message</label> <textarea id="message" rows="10" name="message" placeholder="Why you are reaching out..." class="mt-4 p-1 border-2 border-green-700 focus:border-green-500 block w-100 text-sm rounded-md"></textarea> <button class="focus:outline-none w-32 mt-5 py-2 rounded-md font-semibold text-white bg-green-800 ring-4 ring-green-300" type="submit">Send</button></form></section></div><footer class="w-100 flex mt-10 bg-gradient-to-t from-green-700 to-green-600 mx-0 bg-green-600"><p class="text-sm p-6 justify-start"><span class="text-white mr-4">Tumulty Web Services ©️ 2020</span> <a class="text-white mr-4" href="/sitemap.xml">Sitemap</a> <a class="text-white" href="https://github.com/Tumulty-Web-Services/tumultywebservices.dev">Source Code</a></p></footer></body></html>
